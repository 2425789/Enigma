# Enigma
A cryptography software for my final project. Transforms a file/input into a random encrypted code of arbitrary number. The catch is it would not produce the same code everytime, even with the same input. Misleadingly labeled as 'Hash-code/ function' at the software's documentation as back then I am yet to know what a hash code actually is.
